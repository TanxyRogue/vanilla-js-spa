# vanilla-js-spa

A single page webapp built with vanilla js and no frameworks.

This method or architecture *(Though calling it that given its simplicity is a stretch)* relies on a single a js file that handles all the page routing using the history-api and location-api.

*Note: I plan on making a webapp that allows user to upload vanilla multi-page websites and have them rendered into a simple single page website. So This repo serves as a a place where I test the spa architecture and as a showcase where interested users can see how their final app will look.*
